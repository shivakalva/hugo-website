	• Inside Anaconda Distribution we have python and so many distributions

	• List and Tuples are ordered collection of items
	
	• Sets and Dictionary are unordered collection of items.

	• Python is dynamically typed language that means you can reassign the variable at point of time. May result in errors because of unexpected data types. To some extent we can reduce the intensity of that with the help of the TYPE Operator

	• String = "shiva"
	• String[::]    ----------------  we have 3 spaces in between ":"    ----     1 2 3   --  3 is where we can give step size --- suppose give 2 -- like String[::2] O/P -- sia
	
	
	• String [-1]  reverse the string since  - starts from the end of the string and with step size of 1
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	• Print format can be of two types:   1) .format()   method  and  2) f-strings (formatted string literals)
	
	• print("my name is {}".format("shiva"))
	• my name is shiva
